Description:
This project converts the Gravity Books transactional database into a structured Data Warehouse using SQL Server and SSIS in Visual Studio. Starting from the original normalized ERD, the data was transformed into a dimensional data model with fact and dimension tables to support analytical reporting.

The final warehouse design includes Fact_Orders and Fact_Orders_Acc tables, supported by dimensions such as Book, Author, Customer, Shipping Method, Order Status, and Date, enabling efficient sales analysis and business intelligence reporting.
